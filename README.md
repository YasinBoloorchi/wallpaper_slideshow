# Wallpaper slide show for i3 window manager

This is a simple program which change the wallpaper of your i3 window manager using 'wal' program and open-cv library.

Right now i made the mask pictures my self but for future I have plan to make them with python image library (Pillow or PIL).

For now you can use it for free or maybe you can help me make it better.
